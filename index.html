   <p>Going on a humanitarian trip means setting off on an adventure far from home, to help victims in distress as a result of war, disaster or simply poverty and all the problems that go with it. 
    Between the lack of staff, space and resources, we often call on volunteers from all over the world, or even donations, to help us provide a decent life for the children whose future and lives we are committed to ensuring!
    The aim of humanitarian aid, which is our role after obtaining aid for our establishment and other orphanages, is to provide assistance and protection to vulnerable people, and to meet the needs of populations in danger.

  <h2>``</h2>
  <p>Whether you are a one-time contributor or trying to join our community of contributors, contributing to Flexible Help is one of the most important experiences you will develop in your daily life to bring grace to the lives of children under commitment.
    Your help and your actions help to save lives, relieve suffering, improve health, maintain medical facilities, restore the economic base of victims and also restore their dignity.

     <p>By supporting the Flexibles Helps project and orphanage centre, you are helping us to provide these orphans with a safe, heated roof all year round, daily food, clothing, school lessons, extra-curricular activities and festive moments shared with the other orphans we sponsor.
      Humanitarian aid in certain parts of Africa takes a back seat to our desire to work together with other associations to provide at least the basic necessities to help people find their way in the areas of food and health.

        <h2>Why contribute to projects?</h2>
      <p>Join our cause as a member, volunteer or donate to support our actions to give a family life to those who no longer have parents and those abandoned by their parents.
        Contributing to our projects can be a rewarding way to learn, to have a good heart, to make a donation and to help us build experience in almost any skill you can imagine by giving life and satisfaction to the children in our care and responsibility.
        There are many reasons to help these children who have lost their bearings. To bring them comfort, to help them financially, to give them confidence in the future, to allow them to believe in their dreams.</p>

        <h2>Show your support by contributing to projects</h2>
        <p> Your first and foremost advantage in contributing to Flexible Help is to help children in difficulty. In fact, our establishment represents an opportunity to help the most disadvantaged by enabling them to live in a better environment.
          <br> Flexibles Helps's projects with warm and welcoming communities mean that children have a life with their families that is better than what the fate of abandonment or the death of their parents had in store for them. Many people form friendships, work wonders in our NGO and are blessed for life through their involvement with Flexible Help, whether through conferences, volunteering, remote assistance, online help or donations.
        <br><br> We'd love to have lots of contributors, not just to support our aid to children and orphanages, but also to support our humanitarian aid in poor towns in France, Spain, Portugal, Italy and Africa, not forgetting Palestine which really needs help.</p>

    <h1>About Flexibles Helps</h1>
    <img src="image/logo projet.png">
    <p>With over 06 years' experience at the heart of disaster-stricken areas, the members of Flexibles Helps have concrete expertise in humanitarian aid on the ground, which they have chosen to put at the service of local aid to help children and orphanages in specific areas and volunteers in East-West Europe and West Africa.
      With our in-depth knowledge of the local situation and its particularities, we are in the process of developing an organization on a human scale capable of carrying out targeted and sustainable actions for the most vulnerable.
      Flexibles Helps is a non-profit association under the French Law 290751. You can consult the complete statutes <a href="mailto:flexiblehelp@yahoo.com"><i class="fa-brands fa-yahoo"></i>on request</a>.</p>


  <h1>SOME KEY ASPECTS OF OUR WORK</h1>
  <p>The work of our NGO has a single objective: to respond to the real needs encountered in the field, which can be divided into categories of action.
<br><br>
<strong>The first</strong> : Like all orphanages, Flexible Help aims to bring up and educate destitute children or those from poor families, to protect them physically and morally from the dangers of poverty and idleness, and to enable them, when they are adults, to provide for themselves through work.
To provide a place where children can grow and develop. This project involves building a new orphanage to take in children in difficult situations, particularly orphans and abandoned children. <br><br>


    <strong>The second</strong> : Emergency humanitarian aid. To this day, millions of civilians still fear for their survival, living without access to drinking water, without the ability to feed themselves, in a state of health and material insecurity, all year round, in every season... 
    The aim of our work here is to address the urgency and seriousness of the situation in which they find themselves, and enable them to survive each day in the conditions they face. <br><br>
  
    <strong>The third</strong> : Development aid in poor towns in Europe and Africa. Convinced that the ultimate aim of humanitarian work is to bring about lasting improvements in living conditions, many of our actions in the field are part of this process of rebuilding many aspects of people's lives. Rehousing people in the camps, permanent access to education, building wells, support for the disabled and with it reintegration into social and professional life, (re)launching professional activities and returning to work, rebuilding in order to live again!
